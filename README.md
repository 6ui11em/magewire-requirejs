# Magewire Require JS
![Open Source](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open-Source-1abc9c)

[Magewire](https://github.com/magewirephp/magewire) by default is meant as a Hyva Themes first extension. This means it will only work on Hyva based themes out of the box and will not work on e.g. Luma or Blank based Magento 2 themes (RequireJS dependend themes).

Because most developers want to work with a more modern and fun tech-stack doesn't mean I forgot all those die-hards who still work with the original Magento frontend. Magewire is made compatible via this so-called compatibility extension.

## Installation
```
composer require magewirephp/magewire-requirejs
