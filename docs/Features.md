# Magewire RequireJS - Features
> **Proem**: Please look at Magewire's Features markdown which can be found in the root docs folder inside the core Magewire repo.
> This page only counters features who (still) no work for RequireJS dependend themes. This module will be made
> compatible with official Magewire releases as soon as possible. Don't expect this will go hand in hand.
> 
> Also a lot of examples within the core's examples are based on AlpineJS which obviously won't work within your
> RequireJS based theme. Most will work with minor tweaks.
